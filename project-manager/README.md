We would like to get an understanding of what your technical knowledge is and how you can use it.

There is a test task for you we would like you to work on. Hope you know what Instagram is.
If not, you will have to get familiar with it. The task for you would be to record 5-10 minutes video Youtube podcast on introducing Instagram itself as a service and also coming up and introducing a new feature to Instagram. So you need to think of it and come up with an idea of what piece of functionality you would make available for Instagram users. So once again, your video podcast will need to cover:

1. Short 3 minute presentation of Instagram and it's features
2. How will this new functionality look and work?
3. How will this same functionality be reflected in the web version of the app?
4. Describe how will the web and mobile versions be connected to each other from the technical stand point.

Be creative! Use ONLY english please! Have fun!
